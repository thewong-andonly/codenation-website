                    <p>
                        A comparison between early technology and modern technology is mind boggling.  As a civilisation, we went from the humble typewriter to the desktop computer within the 
                        span of less than half a century.  Another two decades later, both of those machines are superseded ten-fold by a device that can fit into your pocket.
                    <br><br>
                        So, what does this have to do with business? Modern business has also undergone similar radical changes to their model.  
                        Technology allows a supplier in Asia to communicate with their client in New York in real time, something which would have been almost impossible a century ago.  
                        Advancements in technology gives business development teams to make informed decisions based on historical data.  Complex algorithms can build models and predict 
                        future behaviour of financial markets.  Internal business strategies can be efficiently saved and stored with immense amounts of security, preventing such information 
                        from being leaked to a competitor.
                    <br><br>
                        It’s undeniable that IT is not only an essential component of advancing a modern business, but it’s also something that’s here to stay for the foreseeable future.

        <!-- Section 1.2 -->
            <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</h2>
                <h3>What do you need to make projects successful?</h3>
                    <p> 
                        Enabled by modern technology, collaboration across different people and cultures has never been more prevalent.  No matter if we are working on a small hobby 
                        project or we are trying to tie in people all over the glove for a corporation, there are some things every project needs in order to achieve success.
                    <br><br>
                        On that note, the first would be to have a clear definition of success.  Outlining at what point the project becomes successful helps prevent the project from 
                        being delayed or over complicated.
                    <br><br>
                        Once success has been outlined, the right team and mindset is really important, especially with management as they are governing the direction of the project.  
                        Management of the project will need to be strong to prevent resources being spent on a demand which does not contribute to the overall success criteria.  
                    <br><br>
                        Additionally, the right technical team is required who are both able and have enough backing and resources to complete the task at hand by the set deadline.
                    <br><br>
                        Lastly, a common killer of projects is beginning far too quickly and not noticing any of the possible problems.  Identifying pitfalls before the project is 
                        underway can save a significant amount of time in the long run.  These pitfalls then need to be appropriately communicated to all relevant team members involved in 
                        the project so it can be dealt with efficiently and also quickly authorised by senior members of staff to ensure the solution’s rapid deployment.
                    </p>
                <h3>What Tools?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to tools, the first thing which comes to mind is hardware and software. The costs for these can often spiral out of control if purchased without a clear 
                        plan in mind.  Mitigating these costs involve checking if the project can succeed on current machines, the impact using current machines will have on scalability and 
                        future-proofing, and whether or not there is a suitable alternative. In addition to the technical components, there also needs to be methods in place for team members to 
                        flag any bugs and have a clear log of discussions which can be easily continued or edited as solutions may require time to investigate.
                        Both of these need to be cost-effective and good value as well as user friendly.
                    </p>
                <h3>What Skills?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Skills are somewhat of an intangible element to a project although there are always certain recurring traits in a team which lead to success.
                        Ultimately, being a good communicator is an essential skill across all levels of a project and business.  Being unable to effectively present ideas, thoughts, or even 
                        concerns is something which can lead to a breakdown between internal and external customers. Leadership is also required to ensure the project stays on track and has 
                        sufficient backing to avoid any delays or setbacks.

                <p>
                    In terms of creating the website, I aim to have the website with a contrasting theme.  Specifically a dark background and light text to make it easier on the eye and 
                    because, let’s be honest, Dark Theme should be more of common thing by now. After that, I plan on having several pages (Home, About Me, Written Work, possibly another 
                    page) which can be navigated from a nav bar at the top. This will then be completed in the following order:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fill content and create pages.</li>
                            <li>Add background.</li>
                            <li>Add CSS styling.</li>
                            <li>Add formatting.</li>
                        </ol>

        <!-- Section 1.4 -->
            <h2>Section 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
                <h3>What causes digital projects to fail?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Digital projects, like all projects, are at risk of failing due to several factors.  A lack of resources in the form of either cashflow or personnel can often 
                        stifle or even prevent progress of a project as the deadline looms.
                    <br><br>
                        A lack of direction in management can be catastrophic in terms of time management as there's a potential for the project to be more reactionary instead of 
                        proactive, making the team deal with problems as they come which can often require lengthy solutions.  This impacts the project with delays, huge oversights 
                        being identified too late into the project, and having to overcome these issues whilst at a significant time disadvantage.
                    <br><br>
                        This leads into the next point of a project failing as there are often times a point in a project where success can no longer be achieved.  Instead of 
                        discontinuing the project, more time and resources are poured into something which is no longer viable.  It is therefore important to know when a project can no 
                        longer be delivered.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <!-- Section 1.5 -->
            <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software.</h2>
                <h3>How do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Picking the right kind of technology is really important as the right decisions early on pay for themselves the further the project goes.  That being said, this does not 
                        mean the best solutions are always costly.
                    <br><br>
                        The first question to answer would be if the task at hand can be achieved using existing technology already available to the company.  This massively reduces costs and 
                        removes the significant barrier of budget.
                    <br><br>
                        Should it arise additional technology is required, it’s always good to research the market for potential candidates.  Not only should the product be something which is a 
                        great fit for the task, compatibility with existing systems and cost should also factor in to the selection criteria.
                    <br><br>
                        Once products have been shortlisted, contacting the vendor for more information and a live demonstration is key to ensuring the product is suitable to the task.  It’s 
                        also a great time to explore features of the product and build rapport with the vendor in the event of repeat business.
                    <br><br>
                        Lastly, once all the products have been subject to a live test, it’s time to re-evaluate their suitability, in particular using feedback from the team members who will 
                        be directly using the product so an informed decision can be made and a strong case made for the purchasing of new technology.
                    <br><br>
                        In the particular case of the website, I already have VSCode installed and some familiarity with it. Additionally, I'll be using a mixture of HTML and CSS to build the 
                        front end, with possibly some Python for the backend.
                    </p>

            <!-- Section 1.6 -->
            <h2>1.6	Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
                <h3>How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Trello is a really useful tool as it's great to have a visual representation of your project.  During the bootcamp, from a project management point of view, it helps lay 
                        out tasks and actions which can then be tracked and signed off once they’re complete.  On that point, Trello’s design is extremely user friendly which allows multiple 
                        people to access the same Trello board and allowed our team to have a more collaborative working style than a top-down working style.  
                    <br><br>
                        Github is great for making accurate changes and scales really well as you can have a repo which can then be cloned into wherever the website or main app is hosted, making 
                        it easy to change the main body of code with relatively little effort. For the game project, before we used github we were eding then manually passing around our game file 
                        through Slack which eventually ended up with us not being sure who had the latest version.  By pushing to github, it was much easier and clearer to keep on top of version 
                        control.

                <h3>How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
                    <p>
                        GDPR has essentially changed the way in which digital products can be run and now an essential point which must be discussed before the project is underway.  As "personal 
                        data" is such a broad term, if the product involves end users data, it's almost certainly going to involve GDPR.
                    <br><br>
                        GDPR has placed a huge responsibility on technology companies to ensure they take appropriate measures to be clear about what data is collected, how much data will be 
                        collected, how their data will be used, secure their users data from potential leaks and also fulfill the users rights to either access, review, or request deletion 
                        of their personal data.

            <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed.</h2>
                <h3>In making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
                    <p>
                        After looking back on how creation of the website went, I was pleased with the choice of tools used to make my website.  As somebody who has never written HTML or CSS 
                        before, Visual Studio Code is a great, entry level IDE which made writing the code significantly easier. 
                    <br><br>
                        As the project was small scale and I already had a clear idea of what I wanted in my website, I didn’t use Trello although definitely would use it for project managing a 
                        large, more complex team project.
                    <br><br>
                        Lastly, W3schools was a great resource for troubleshooting and explaining concepts I hadn’t quite fully grasped and allowed me to really bring all components of my 
                        website together.
                    <br><br>
                        Looking back, for the project I think all the tools used were great for completing the objective at hand and wouldn’t change anything if I were to repeat it.

                <p>
                    The use of Visual Studio Code was extremely helpful.  After using other IDEs previously (Sublime Text, namely), I found VSCode to be something which is versatile 
                    enough to be helpful although not complicated enough to be daunting to use.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Overall, I’m happy with my final project as I achieved what I wanted to at the start.  A clean and minimalist feel to the website which encompasses, under the hood, 
                        very basic code although has a nice look to it.
                    <br><br>
                        That being said, what I would change about the website is adding more CSS elements to increase the visual aspect of the website.  Subtle animations on the nav bar buttons 
                        and animations on the welcome page text would be something I would start with.
                    <br><br>
                        Additionally, I would include more relevant content in the form of a blog to relay my experience as a self-taught programmer.  At the moment, the content is fairly niche and not very personal or varied.

                <p>
                    Building on the previous improvements, I’d also create the “Written Work” section as fully functioning blog, allowing comments, sharing, and opportunity for discussion.  
                    Additionally, I’d add a simple “Contact me” page which would allow potential collaborators to get in touch and talk about opportunities to work together.  
                <br><br>
                    Both of these would involve using a framework such as Flask or Django for the backend which I could then incorporate Python into.

                <p>
                    The purpose of the website was to both showcase and develop knowledge in HTML and CSS.  When looking at the website, I feel the outcome has been achieved.  It has the look I was aiming for, the layout I had originally planned, and was completed on time.  On reflection of this criteria, I believe the website has fulfilled the purpose for which it was originally intended.

            <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency.</h2>
                <h3>Could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h3>
                    <p>
                        IT tools and systems are essential to getting a group project to work as there is often many plates spinning simultaneously.  They help plan, visualise, and 
                        discuss the progress of the project as well as reliably map it as opposed to using a single project manager with no involvement from the other team members.
                        For group work, it is hard to envisage a successful project without them.
                    <br><br>
                        There are drawbacks to using these tools though.  When it comes to solo projects, if the project creator already has a strong direction for the project, adding in 
                        additional tools can often end up hindering as they’re essentially adding admin for ideas which do not need to be communicated or referred to later.
                    <br><br>
                        Furthermore, when it comes to admin, there can be too much of a good thing.  If there are superfluous tools, it can lead to a duplication of tracked information and 
                        ends up being a time sink instead of useful.
                    <br><br>        
                        As the website was a solo project, additional project management tools were unnecessary as I had already knew how I wanted my website to look and would have found it 
                        difficult to build somebody else’s website as there would be a lot of back-and-forth to check both of us are seeing the same idea.
                    <br><br>        
                        As the website is a very simple conception, working in a team would mean we could have more features and more idea to the website, although I am uncertain if that 
                        would necessarily be more efficient.

            <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Productivity and efficiency are always at the forefront of project work as the time saved can often be spent elsewhere, making the project more successful overall. 
                        Additional time could be spent on identifying project ending problems or creating something which would be a huge quality of life increase to the user experience.
                    <br><br>
                        Efficiency and productivity go hand in hand and often being with thorough planning.  By planning ahead into the future and aiming to complete a list of tasks within a 
                        certain time frame really influences progress.  That progress over time should be tracked in some way so it can be visually represented and shown to other internal or 
                        external stakeholders. An additional benefit is tracked progress can be used as tool to highlight bottlenecks in the process and presents itself a compelling argument 
                        for additional resources.
                    <br><br>
                        Another technical aspect to productivity is being able to pivot away from problems, which are simply too time consuming to fix, or features which are take too long to 
                        implement, once new information has been obtained.  Sometimes it’s better to give up on an already built losing strategy in favour of something which has the chance to 
                        work.
                    <br><br>
                        A less technical aspect worth mentioning is maintaining well-being.  Having frequent, short breaks away from the workstation to get a drink and giving your eyes a rest from the monitor is a great way of feeling refreshed.
                    <br><br>        
                        Lastly, encouraging good team work and communication between team members is something which is great for encouraging productivity.  A team of individuals who are aiming 
                        to be the best performer are often outshone by a team of people who are willing to work together.

            <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Productivity was something was fairly good overall although could have been definitely improved.  For team projects, time is often lost from a lack of direction and for that appointing a project manager or group leader who can make executive decisions can only save time and something we would definitely implement if we were to repeat group work.
                    <br><br>
                        Giving everybody defined roles and tasks is something which was great at increasing productivity.  With everybody in the team knowing the job list, it allows to have a flexible schedule and thus work when they’re in a focussed state of mind rather than being distracted.  This has been doubly valuable in a time when working from home has never been more prevalent.
                    </p>
            <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once a project is past the concept stage and has been built, it has to be thoroughly tested in order to make sure it is able to work as intended.  
                    <br><br>
                        Implementing a detailed error logging system is a great way of monitoring how well a product is handling various tasks whether it’s handling users connecting, data load, or even potential security breaches it’s always good to have a record of what hasn’t gone smoothly.  With that comes an established method of handling these errors, recording the solution so they can be referred to should it happen again, and applying a, ideally, permanent fix to the problem. 
                    <br><br>
                        Stress testing the products capabilities is something else which should be explored and something which small businesses and websites discover too late when they unexpectedly go viral.  Knowing the limits of a product should be important so decisions can be made on whether to invest more into expanding the infrastructure or not well ahead of time.
                    <br><br>
                        From a non-technical point of view, gathering feedback from focus groups of potential users is also important to reinforce any decisions and to make sure the product remains on point to the desired audiences.

            <h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h2>
            <h2>1.1.2 Describing the content and layout for each page/</h2>
                    <p>
                        The look I was aiming for the website was something clean and minimal.  It’s an aesthetic I’m a huge fan of as I spent some time dreaming of being a web designer during my years as a teenager and frequently envisaged creating really striking visuals with minimal content.
                    <br><br>
                        Let’s start the recurring elements.
                    <br><br>
                        The background is a lovely wallpaper of the Annapurna Massif mountains which is freely available online.  I made sure to get a higher resolution image version as I didn’t know how this would look once it got transplanted into the HTML page.  On this page, I wanted the title in a white font with some styling (the h1 has some shadow behind it), and the navbar.
                    <br><br>
                        The navbar has similar styling to the h1.  It’s a white font and the other pages separated by the pipe symbol.  I also added the feature of the text glowing on hover to let the user know they’re clickable links.  Below the pages are my socials, namely LinkedIn and Github which are their well-known logos.  These are hyperlinked to go to my personal pages.  Lastly, the footer is a mention of Code Nation and links to their page – I’m sure they’ll appreciate the absolute minimal traffic the link will generate.
                    <br><br>
                        The two additional pages are an About Me page and the Written Work with both of them essentially being the same format; text under the navbar.  I spent some time researching what colour font would be complementary to the mountain background and I was fortunate in finding a decent colour match fairly quickly.  This was to be formatted using, again, another clean and established font (arial), however, with the Written Work page, I thought it would be a good opportunity to make use of different font sizing to signify the difference between titles, subtitles, and content.
                    <br><br>
                        That sums up all of the elements of my website!
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
                    <p>
                        The online world allows for information to be shared freely, including written content such as text and visual content such as graphics.  Whilst this is great in so many ways, the issue lies with it being easy for another person to steal another’s work and claim it as their own.
                    <br><br>
                        This really affects websites because copyrights are prevalent everywhere.  Popular gaming streaming service Twitch.tv, owned by Amazon, had significant backlash from their community due to their exercise of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Despite streamers listening to a variety of music in the background being an almost ubiquitous occurrence, Twitch decided to mass delete all content which had any music playing in the background protected by the DMCA, resulting in thousands of streamers content being removed from Twitch’s website.
                    <br><br>
                
                        This is just one, prominent example about the importance of doing due diligence and appropriately crediting content creators featured in a live digital product. 
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h2>1.6.2 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s important to consider accessibility when it comes to webpages as all webpages should be designed so they can be enjoyed by everybody and that design, in itself, comes with challenges which must be overcome.
                    <br><br>
                        With the web being a very visual and auditory experience, these would be two of the more challenging obstacles to address when it comes to web design. For those who are hard of hearing, a simple fix would be any media content to have subtitles or even an optional sign language speaker.  
                    <br><br>
                        For those with a visual disability, making content which is optimised to be accessed by assistive screen reader technology by, for example, allowing text to be in place of images.  For conditions such as colour vision deficiency, an optional mode to activate colours which cater to the user’s particular vision deficiency would be a great solution to implement at the start of the project.
                    <br><br>
                        Ultimately, as designers, it is up to us to maintain what the internet allows – inclusivity and access for all.
                    </p>
                <br>
            <h2>1.7.2 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are many filetypes for the same type of media available to use whether it’s a JPG, an SVG, a PNG, an MP3, a WAV, an MP4, or an MPEG, the list goes on and on.  But why should we care about the format?
                    <br><br>
                        The format matters because from a user experience perspective, nobody enjoys having a slow, unresponsive experience when using a website.  So, the first port of call would be an image which can be easily loaded i.e small in size and static as opposed to an animated image which constantly loops (I’m a huge advocate of animated media only loading when you want it to).
                    <br><br>
                        Quality is also an important factor in this careful balancing act as it can sometimes lead to alienating users.  Popular media streaming websites change based on the quality the user can support, actively switching to a lower quality if the higher resolutions are causing buffering.
