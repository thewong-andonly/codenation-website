        <p>
          I'm a Synthetic Organic Chemist with around 6 years of experience in the field, specifically in drug discovery, scaling up to kilo scale production, and finally full plant production.

          In my last role, our data management practices were non-existent and there was a big push to move us into the modern day.  During this time, we were doing
          a significant amount of manual input and, me being exceptionally lazy, looked for a quicker way.
      <br><br>
          This was when I started programming in Python and learning more about programming in general.  I've always loved tech and been a fan of building my own PCs,
          although really got into coding around June 2020.
      <br><br>
          Aside from coding, I'm a huge fan of combat sports and love to practice Muay Thai.  Naturally, this facilitates my other hobby of eating.  I love cooking in my spare time
          and wish I had more free time to do more.  I'm also a really big PC gaming person, hence, the previous mention of building my own PCs (frames win games, after all).
